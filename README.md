this plugin engine makes player takeover the server.

this plugin may cause revolution such as...
1. cause player takeover the server file system to install ViaProxy and plugins to the server, making the public viaproxy.
2. cause player takeover the permissions.
3. cause revolution
4. makes player run /deop command
5. lock "ban" command for op and console to use.

this plugin is only useful for wars between servers only. 
if you want to war but don't want to taking over the server, it's best to ally with the server with the same Ideologies and run ViaProxy There.(example: if your server and clan has anti-ign&anti-endzone&anti-anarchyac Ideology, find the anarchy server that has anti-ign&anti-endzone&anti-anarchyac Ideology and run viaproxy here.), otherwise, you can use clouds, or pay for the server hosting. (However, you can contact your server hosting to support DNS for Free Server)
